Obfuscate files via the Luraph API from the comfort of your VS Code editor.

*The official [Luraph API documentation](https://lura.ph/dashboard/documents/apidoc) contains the most up-to-date and complete information and instructions for integrating with the Luraph API.*

**Luraph API access is only available for accounts under certain plans. For more information, please check out the pricing plans on the [Luraph website](https://lura.ph/#pricing).**

## Installation

- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=luraph.luraph-vscode)
- [Latest VSIX file](https://github.com/luraph/luraph-vscode/releases/latest) ([How to install VS Code extensions from a VSIX file?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix "Visual Studio Code: Install from a VSIX"))

## Usage

*Before using this extension, you should set your Luraph API key as the `luraph.API Key` setting. If you attempt to obfuscate without one set, you will be prompted to enter an API key.*

To obfuscate, open the file to be obfuscated, and then click on the `Obfuscate with Luraph` item in the status bar at the bottom of the window or use the `Luraph: Obfuscate File` command. That's it!
